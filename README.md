#PROJECT ON GPS TOLL-BASED SYSTEM USING PYTHON by Team BIT GEEKS,
 This is a public repository and it includes all the necessary code base, documentation, output records etc.
 Our project, the GPS-Based Automated Toll Collection System, revolutionizes toll management by using GPS technology to accurately calculate toll charges based on highway and alternate path travel distances. It leverages advanced mapping and pathfinding tools to determine routes, ensuring efficient and precise toll calculations. Additionally, the system features automated SMS notifications through Twilio, keeping users informed about toll charges and journey details in real-time, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for modern travelers.


Include user_data.csv,pathfile.txt in Original Source Code
Include pathfile1.txt, pathfile2.txt in Source Code2- alternate traveling
Include acpath.gpx in streamlit_app1.py

Output files are : 
gps_animation.gif, gps_animation2.gif and gps_animation3.gif
